Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ( CORS )

- CORS is a mechanism for  integrating applications
- CORS defines are loaded in one domain to interest with different domain
- CORS allows client borwser to check with third-party servers (if request auth before data transfer)
- To protect cross-site request forgery ( csrf )


= Same-Origin policy (27:00 min)

URL                                                 Outcome                 Reason
http://dltbank.com/transfer/create.html             Same Origin
http://dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html       Same Origin             Only path different
http://mm.dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html    Different Origin        Different protocol
http://tha.dltbank.com:81/transfer/create.html      Different Origin        Different port (https:// is port 80 by default )
http://news.dltbank.com:81/article.html             Different Origin        Different Host


Same-origin policy is highly secure but inflexible for genius/ general use cases.
CORS is an extension of the same-origin policy
You need CORS when you to pull data from external AIPs that are public or authorized or ( authorized third-party access to your own server )
