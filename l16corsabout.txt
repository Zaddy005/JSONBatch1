= Same-Origin policy

URL                                                 Outcome                 Reason
http://dltbank.com/transfer/create.html             Same Origin
http://dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html       Same Origin             Only path different
http://mm.dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html    Different Origin        Different protocol
http://tha.dltbank.com:81/transfer/create.html      Different Origin        Different port (https:// is port 80 by default )
http://news.dltbank.com:81/article.html             Different Origin        Different Host

Same-origin policy is highly secure but inflexible for genius use cases.
CORS is an extension of the same-origin policy
You need CORS when you to pull data from external AIPs that are public or authorized or ( authorized third-party access to your own server )
